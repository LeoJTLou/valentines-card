                    <p>My dear Lucinda,</p>
                    <p>Happy valentines day!</p>
                    <p>Even though we are very far apart, I still love you and miss you everyday. I think about you every single day.</p>
                    <p>Since I am not sure what to give you, I have decided to make this little app for you.</p>
                    <p>You mean the world to me, and I am so grateful to have you in my life.</p>
                    <p>You were there for me during the hardest times in my life and you have always been supportive of me since the day we met.</p>
                    <p>In return, I want to provide you with the best life that you deserve. You deserve to be protected and to be loved.</p>
                    <p>Although I may not be the perfect man, I am willing to be the best man I can be for you.</p>
                    <p>I initially had other plans for this digital card to be honest, but with work and me being an idiot and not starting the project sooner, this is the best I can give you.</p>
                    <p>I love you with all my heart, and I am confident that we will find a way to be together and live a happy and amazing life.</p>
                    <p>Love,</p>
                    <p>Leo</p>
